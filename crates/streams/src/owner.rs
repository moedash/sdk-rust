//! What the stream layer asks Temporal about a stream's owner.
//!
//! A store can't see a Workflow close, so the layer above it asks: to find the chain a stream is
//! keyed by, to refuse a producer once the chain ended, and to end a read. Core implements this
//! over its client, and tests use a fake.

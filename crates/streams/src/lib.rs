//! Stream stores for Temporal Workflows.
//!
//! A stream is a topic of a Workflow, kept in a store outside Temporal and keyed by the
//! Workflow's run chain. This crate holds what every store and every SDK share: the
//! [StreamStore] trait a store implements, the cursor format, the record helpers that stamp and
//! fingerprint records, and the error every call fails with. Lang reaches a store through Core's
//! `StreamService`, and Core's Worker stages and promotes a Workflow's own output through the
//! same trait.

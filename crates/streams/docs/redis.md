# The Redis stream store

The store on the application's Redis.

Records live in Redis and never pass through Temporal. The key layout, the stored values and
the Lua scripts are the ones the SDKs used before the store moved into Core, so a stream one
wrote stays readable and writable by the other.

**Appends.** One script writes a whole batch, so a reader never sees part of one. The topic's
meta hash keeps one field per producer attempt: the newest batch's first sequence, its record
count, its first and last entry ids, and lang's digest of it in hex.

**Retention.** Every script that writes a log trims it with `XTRIM MINID` to the retention and
slides the expiry of the log and its meta, so a stream dies a retention after its last write
and nobody cleans up when the Workflow closes. The meta outlives its log by a 30-day grace, as
the tombstone that tells a log that expired from one that never existed.

**Stages.** A Workflow's own output is staged next to its logs and moved into them by one
script, so readers see a Workflow Task's records together or not at all.

**Server.** Redis 7.0 or later is required, and the store refuses an older server when it
connects. At the same moment it reads `maxmemory-policy` on every primary and logs a warning
for anything but `noeviction`, since an evicting Redis drops whole stream keys under memory
pressure, losing records and their dedupe state.

**ACL.** Every key of a namespace's streams starts with `<prefix>:{<namespace>:`, each part
percent-encoded. A Redis ACL user for one namespace's applications, with the rules the
conformance suite runs as:

```text
ACL SETUSER streams-app on >secret resetkeys ~temporal-streams:{my-ns:* resetchannels -@all +evalsha +eval +script|load +multi +exec +xadd +xread +xrevrange +xrange +xtrim +xlen +hget +hset +hgetall +hincrby +hdel +hscan +rpush +lrange +exists +del +unlink +pexpire +pttl +time +info +config|get +ping +hello +client|setinfo
```

Deleting an owner's streams also needs `+scan`, and so does ending a run chain when stream
notifications are on, since the store lists the chain's open topics to close their notifiers. A
chain end scans each primary's keyspace once. `+config|get` only reads
`maxmemory-policy`, and the store goes on when a server refuses it.

**Tests.** The Redis tests run when `STREAMS_REDIS_URL` names a standalone server and
`STREAMS_REDIS_CLUSTER_URL` a cluster seed. `scripts/redis-test-servers.sh` starts both. The
conformance suite runs on each, and once more as a user with exactly the ACL above. The
cross-implementation test also needs `STREAMS_BROOK_PY`, a Python SDK checkout whose provider
predates the move.
